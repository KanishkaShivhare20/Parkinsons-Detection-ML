# ðŸ§  Parkinson's Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect Parkinson's Disease based on biomedical voice measurements. It is built in Python and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Early detection of Parkinson's Disease is crucial for treatment. This project uses an ML model trained on voice-based features to predict if a person has Parkinson's Disease.
